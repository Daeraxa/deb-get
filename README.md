## Introduction

There are application vendors and projects who express their support for Debian
and Ubuntu by publishing `.debs` of their software as direct downloads or via
their own officially supported apt archives. `deb-get` makes it easy to find,
install and update `.debs` published in this way.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wimpysworld/deb-get.git
cd deb-get
sudo ./deb-get
```
